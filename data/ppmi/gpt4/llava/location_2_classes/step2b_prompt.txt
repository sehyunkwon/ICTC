You will be provided a list of [__LEN__] locations where person exists and the number of occurences in a given dataset. Your job is to cluster [__LEN__] words into [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] categories. Provide your answer as a list of [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] words, each word representing a location. 

For example, if the input is given as "{'a': 15, 'b': 25, 'c': 17}", it means that the label 'a', 'b', and 'c' appeared 15, 25, 17 times in the data, respectively. 

When categorizing classes, consider the following criteria:

1. Each cluster should have roughly the same number of images.
2. Merge clusters with similar meanings.
3. Each cluster should not have multiple classes of different locations.
4. Each cluster represents a general location and should not be too specific.

Now you will be given a list of locations and the number of classes, and the list of classes you answered previously.

Please output a list of locations of length [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__], in the following format: "{index}: {location}". Make sure that you strictly follow the length condition, which means that {index} must range from 1 to [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__].
