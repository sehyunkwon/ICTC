You will be provided a list of [__LEN__] musical instruments and the number of occurences in a given dataset.

For example, if the input is given as "{'a': 15, 'b': 25, 'c': 17}", it means that the label 'a', 'b', and 'c' appeared 15, 25, 17 times in the data, respectively.

Your job is to cluster [__LEN__] words into [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] categories. Provide your answer as a list of [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] words, each word representing a musical instrument.

When categorizing classes, consider the following criteria:

1. Each cluster should have roughly the same number of images.
2. Merge clusters with similar meanings with a superclass.

For example, if the input is given as "{'poodle': 15, 'cat': 25, 'golden retriever': 17}" as above, and if you are given 2 as the number of classes, an exemplar answer would be "{'dog': 32, 'cat':25}" where you have merged the 'poodle' and 'golden retriever' into a 'dog' class, as the canonical superclass of the two is the 'dog' class. 

Now you will be given a list of musical instruments and the number of classes, and the list of classes you answered previously.

Please output a list of musical instruments of length [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__], in the following format: "{index}: {instrument}". Make sure that you strictly follow the length condition, which means that {index} must range from 1 to [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__].
