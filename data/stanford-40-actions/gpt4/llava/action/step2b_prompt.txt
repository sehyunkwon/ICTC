You will be provided a list of [__LEN__] human actions and the number of occurences in a given dataset. Your job is to cluster [__LEN__] words into [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] actions. Provide your answer as a list of [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] words, each word representing a human action.

For example, if the input is given as "{'a': 15, 'b': 25, 'c': 17}", it means that the label 'a', 'b', and 'c' appeared 15, 25, 17 times in the data, respectively.

When categorizing classes, consider the following criteria:

1. Each cluster should have roughly the same number of images.
2. Each cluster should not have multiple classes of different actions.

Now you will be given a list of human actions and the number of classes, and the list of classes you answered previously.

Please output a list of human actions of length [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__], in the following format: "{index}: {actions}". Make sure that you strictly follow the length condition, which means that {index} must range from 1 to [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__].
