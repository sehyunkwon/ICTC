You will be provided a list of [__LEN__] objects and the number of occurences in a given dataset. Your job is to cluster [__LEN__] words into [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] categories. Provide your answer as a list of [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] words, each word representing a category. 

You must provide your answer in the following format "Answer {index}: {object}", where {index} is the index of the category and {object} is the object representing the category. For example, if you think the first category is "station", then you should provide your answer as "Answer 1: station".

When categorizing classes, consider the following criteria:

1. The sizes of each cluster should be similar. For instance, no cluster should have too many elements allocated, while certain clusters should not have too few elements assigned.
2. Merge similar clusters. For example, [sparrow, eagle, falcon, owl, hawk] should be combined into a single cluster called 'birds of prey'.
3. The cluster should be differentiated based on where the animals live.
4. Each cluster should be differentiated.

Please output a list of objects of length [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__], in the following format: "{index}: {object}".
